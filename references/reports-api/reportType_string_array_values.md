## Order tracking reports

These order tracking reports are available in North America (NA) and Europe (EU). For all sellers. These reports return all orders, regardless of fulfillment channel or shipment status. These reports are intended for order tracking, not to drive a seller's fulfillment process, as the reports do not include customer-identifying information and scheduling is not supported. Also note that for self-fulfilled orders, item price is not shown for orders in a "pending" state.

## Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) reports

There are limits to how often Amazon will generate FBA reports. These limits depend on whether an FBA report is a near real-time report or a daily report. See the following table to see which FBA reports are near real-time and which are daily.

A near real-time FBA report is generated no more than once every 30 minutes. This means that after a near real-time FBA report is generated following your report request, a 30-minute waiting period must pass before Amazon will generate an updated version of that report. Note that the four "All Orders" reports are not subject to this limitation.

A daily FBA report is generated no more than once every four hours. This means that after a daily FBA report is generated following your report request, a four-hour waiting period must pass before Amazon will generate an updated version of that report.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If <strong>RootNodesOnly</strong> and <strong>BrowseNodeId</strong> are both included in the <strong>reportOptions</strong> parameter, <strong>RootNodesOnly</strong> takes precedence.</p>

If there is ever a conflict between a <strong>MarketplaceIdList</strong> parameter value and the <strong>MarketplaceId</strong> value of the <strong>reportOptions</strong> parameter, the <strong>MarketplaceId</strong> value takes precedence.</p>

<p>To keep track of which browse nodes change over time, Amazon recommends that each time you request this report you compare it to the last report you requested using the same <strong>reportOptions</strong> values.</p>
