# What is the Reports API?

With the Selling Partner API for Reports (Reports API), you can build applications that enable sellers to get reports from Amazon that help them manage their selling business. There are reports for a wide variety of use cases, such as monitoring inventory, tracking orders for fulfillment, getting tax information, tracking returns and seller performance, managing a selling business with Fulfillment by Amazon, and more. See the [Reports API Reference](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md) for details about Reports API operations and associated data types and schemas. See [reportType values](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reporttype-values.md) for the available report types.

The two principal workflows for generating reports are requesting a report and scheduling a report.

**Requesting a report**

You can request any available report type on demand using the createReport operation. See [Tutorial: Request and retrieve a report](#tutorial-request-and-retrieve-a-report) for instructions.

**Scheduling a report**

You can have Amazon automatically submit report requests on a schedule using the createReportSchedule operation. See [Tutorial: Schedule and retrieve reports](#tutorial-schedule-and-retrieve-reports) for instructions for scheduling reports.

## Terminology

- **S3 pre-signed URL**. A URL for an AWS S3 bucket from which you can download an object without AWS security credentials or permissions.

# Tutorial: Request and retrieve a report

Here are the high-level steps for requesting a report:

1. Call the [createReport](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#createreport) operation, specifying the type of report and the marketplaces that you are requesting, and any optional parameters that you want.

   Amazon receives the report request. If the operation is successful, the response includes a **reportId** value.

1. Periodically call the [getReport](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#getreport) operation, passing the **reportId** value from the previous step, until the **processingStatus** value in the response indicates that processing has ended. Processing will have ended when the **processingStatus** equals CANCELLED, DONE or FATAL. At this point the response includes a **reportDocumentId** value if there is report data available.

1. Call the [getReportDocument](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#getreportdocument) operation, passing the **reportDocumentId** value from the previous step.

   Amazon returns a pre-signed URL for the location of the report document, and the compression algorithm used if the report document contents have been compressed.

1. Download the report.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- A report type to request. See [reportType values](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reporttype-values.md) for a list of the available report types.

- Authorization from the seller for whom you are making calls. See the [Selling Partner API Developer Guide](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/guides/en-US/developer-guide/SellingPartnerApiDeveloperGuide.md) for more information.

- To use the sample code in this guide, a working Java Development Kit (JDK) installation.

## Step 1. Request a report

Request a report by specifying the report type and marketplaces that you are requesting, and any optional parameters.

- Call the [createReport](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#createreport) operation, passing the following parameters:

    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
      <td>dataEndTime</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Request example:

```
POST https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com/reports/2021-06-30/reports
{
  "reportType": "GET_MERCHANT_LISTINGS_ALL_DATA",
  "dataStartTime": "2019-12-10T20:11:24.000Z",
  "marketplaceIds": [
    "A1PA6795UKMFR9",
    "ATVPDKIKX0DER"
  ]
}
```

**Response**

A successful response includes the following property:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr class="header">
      <th>
        <strong>Name</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Description</strong>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>
        <strong>reportId</strong>
      </td>
      <td>The identifier for the report. This identifier is unique only in combination with a seller ID.<p>Type: string</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Response example:

```json
{
  "reportId": "ID323"
}
```

## Step 2. Confirm that report processing has completed

After you call the createReport operation, Amazon receives the request and begins processing the report. You must then confirm that processing has completed before you continue.

- Periodically call the [getReport](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#getreport) operation, passing the **reportId** value from the previous step, until the **processingStatus** value in the response indicates that processing has ended. Processing will have ended when the **processingStatus** equals CANCELLED, DONE or FATAL. At this point the response includes a **reportDocumentId** value if there is report data available.

  Here are the **processingStatus** values that confirm that processing has ended:

  - CANCELLED - The report was cancelled. There are two ways a report can be cancelled: an explicit cancellation request before the report starts processing, or an automatic cancellation if there is no data to return.

  - DONE - The report has completed processing and a **reportDocumentId** is available.

  - FATAL - The report was aborted due to a fatal error and a **reportDocumentId** may be present. If present, the report represented by the **reportDocumentId** may explain why the report processing ended.

  The following **processingStatus** values indicate that processing has _not_ ended, and you should continue to call the getReport operation until the operation returns a **processingStatus** of CANCELLED, DONE or FATAL.

  - IN_PROGRESS - The report is being processed.

  - IN_QUEUE - The report has not yet started processing. It may be waiting for another IN_PROGRESS report.

  **Note**: The getReport operation only serves information for on-demand or scheduled report requests that were created within the last 90 days.

}
```

## Step 3. Retrieve the report

To retrieve the report, see [How to Retrieve a Report](#how-to-retrieve-a-report).

# Tutorial: Schedule and retrieve reports

You can schedule requests for reports so that they are submitted periodically, using the createReportSchedule operation. Use the period enumeration to specify the time period. To identify which reports can be scheduled, review the <a href="https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reporttype-values.md">reportType values</a> in the Selling Partner API documentation.

Here are the high-level steps for scheduling and retrieving reports:

1. Call the [createReportSchedule](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#createreportschedule) operation to create a schedule for periodically submitting report requests. Specify **reportType, marketplaceIds** and **period** values and any optional parameters. For **reportType** values, see [reportType values](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reporttype-values.md). For **period** values, see [period enumeration](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#period).

   **Note**: If a report schedule with the same report type and marketplace IDs already exists, it will be cancelled and replaced with this one. Otherwise a new report schedule will be created.

1. Periodically call the [getReports](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#getreports) operation using an interval that is similar to the schedule that you configured in the previous step.

   If a call to the getReports operation succeeds, the response contains an array of report information, including **reportDocumentId** values if report data is available.

   **Note**: The getReports operation only serves information for on-demand or scheduled report requests that were created within the last 90 days.

1. For each **reportDocumentId**:

   1. Call the [getReportDocument](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#getreportdocument) operation, passing the **reportDocumentId** value.

      Amazon returns a pre-signed URL for the location of the report document, and the compression algorithm used if the report document contents have been compressed.

   1. Download the report.<br>

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- A report type to schedule. See [reportType values](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reporttype-values.md) for a list of the available report types.

## Step 2: Periodically retrieve information about the scheduled reports

Periodically call the getReports operation using an interval that is similar to the schedule that you configured. You'll want to try to time these calls so that they occur after scheduled reports are likely to have been completed.

1. Call the [getReports](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#getreports) operation periodically to retrieve information about scheduled reports, passing the following parameters:

**Response**

A successful response includes the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr class="header">
      <th>
        <strong>Name</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Description</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Schema</strong>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>reports</td>
      <td>
        The reports.
      </td>

      </td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>

The **ReportList** array in the response contains a [Report](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#report) object for each processed report, and that **Report** object contains the **reportDocumentId**.

**Note**: Information about both on-demand and scheduled reports is returned. To identify scheduled reports, look for the presence of a **reportScheduleId** in the **Report** object in the response. The **reportScheduleId** indicates which schedule submitted this report request.

2. For each **reportDocumentId**, save the **reportDocumentId** and go to Step 3 to retrieve the report.

## Step 3: Retrieve the report

To retrieve a report, see [How to Retrieve a Report](#how-to-retrieve-a-report).

# How to Retrieve a Report

Get your report by first getting the information required to retrieve a report document and then downloading the report.

**Steps**

[Step 1. Get information required to retrieve the report](#step-1-get-information-required-to-retrieve-the-report)

[Step 2. Download the report](#step-2-download-the-report)

## Step 1. Get information required to retrieve the report

Call the getReportDocument operation to get the information required for retrieving a report document's contents. This includes a pre-signed URL for the report document and optionally, the compression algorithm used if the report document contents have been compressed.

1. Call the [getReportDocument](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#getreportdocument) operation, passing the following parameter:

Path parameter:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr class="header">
      <th>
        <strong>Name</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Description</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Required</strong>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>reportDocumentId</td>
      <td>The identifier for the report document.<p>Type: string</p>
      </td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Request example:

```plain
GET https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com/reports/2021-06-30/documents/DOC-b8b0-4226-b4b9-0ee058ea5760
```

**Response**

A successful response includes the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr class="header">
      <th>
        <strong>Name</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Description</strong>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>reportDocumentId</td>
      <td>The identifier for the report document. This identifier is unique only in combination with a seller ID.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
      <td>url</td>
      <td>
        A pre-signed URL for the report document. This URL expires after 5 minutes.
        <p>Type: string</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>compressionAlgorithm</td>
      <td>If present, the report document contents have been compressed with the provided algorithm.<p>Type: enum (<a href="https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/references/reports-api/reports_2021-06-30.md#compressionalgorithm">CompressionAlgorithm</a>)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Response example:

```json
{
  "reportDocumentId": "DOC-b8b0-4226-b4b9-0ee058ea5760",
  "url": "https://d34o8swod1owfl.cloudfront.net/SampleResult%2BKey%3DSample%2BINITVEC%3D58+fa+bf+a7+08+11+95+0f+c1+a8+c6+e0+d5+6f+ae+c8"
}
```

2. Save the **url**, and **compressionAlgorithm** (optional property) for use in Step 2.

## Step 2. Download the report

You will need to download the report using the information returned in the previous step. The following sample code demonstrates a way to download a plain text report document. You can also use the principles demonstrated in the sample code to guide you in building applications in other programming languages, or for other types of documents (XML,CSV,TSV, etc.). 

1. Use the following as inputs for the sample code:

   - The **url** and optional **compressionAlgorithm** values from the previous step are arguments for the `url`, and `compressionAlgorithm` parameters of the `download` method of the `DownloadExample` class.

**Note**: It's the developer's responsibility to always maintain encryption at rest. Unencrypted report content should never be stored on disk, even temporarily, because reports can contain sensitive information. The sample code that we provide demonstrates this principle.

# Best practices

## Expect changes to reports

Amazon periodically adds new fields and field values to reports. Be sure that any report parsers that you build into your applications can gracefully handle these types of report updates.

## Don't rely on document ID structure

You should not rely on the format and structure of document identifiers. The format and structure is subject to change.
